The script in this directory can parse a heap dump from an android java app
and generate the list of classes that have been loaded.

To generate a class list do the following:
// get the process id of the app
adb shell ps | grep YOUR_APP_NAME (FIXME: second numeric value is the pid)
// tell activity manager to dump the heap. You'll need root for this on the phone
adb shell am dumpheap <pid> /data/local/tmp/SOMEDUMP.hprof
// copy the heap to your host computer
adb pull /data/local/tmp/SOMEDUMP.hprof YOUR_DIR_HERE/.
// pass the heap dump to the python script for parsing and printing out the class list
python dump_classes_from_hprof.py --hprof YOUR_DIR_HERE/SOMEDUMP.hprof > list_of_classes.txt

Sometimes hprof files seem to be malformed, i.e., an object might be referenced
but not defined. In some cases it is reasonable to ignore these cases. You may
try to add `--allow_missing_ids` to the command line.
